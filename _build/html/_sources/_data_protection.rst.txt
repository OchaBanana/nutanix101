Protection Domains

#. In **Prism Element > Data Protection > Table**, click **+ Protection Domain > Async DR** to begin creating a PD.

   .. note::

      Synchronous replication (Metro Availability) is currently support on ESXi and will be supported in AHV in a future release.

#. When opening the Data Protection context of the menu a warning screen will appear. Click on the **OK** button to move forward.

#. Provide a name for the PD, and click **Create**.

#. Filter or scroll to select the VMs created during this lab that you want to add to the PD.

#. Click **Protect Selected Entities** and verify the VMs appear under **Protected Entities**.

   Consistency groups allow you to group multiple VMs to be snapshot at the same time, e.g. multiple VMs belonging to the same application.

   .. note:: Nutanix snapshots can perform application consistent snapshots for supported operating systems with NGT installed. Each VM using application consistent snapshots will be part of its own consistency group.

#. Click **Next**.

#. Click **New Schedule** to define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and retention.

#. Configure your desired snapshot frequency (e.g. Repeat every 1 hour)

   .. note::

      AHV supports NearSync snapshots, with RPOs as low as 1 minute.

   .. note::

      Multiple schedules can be applied to the same PD, allowing you to take and retain X number of hourly, daily, monthly snapshots.

#. Configure a retention policy (e.g. Keep the last 5 snapshots)

   .. note::

      For environments with remote cluster(s) configured, setting up replication is as easy as defining how many snapshots to keep at each remote site.
